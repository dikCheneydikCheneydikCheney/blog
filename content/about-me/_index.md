# Howdy everyone, my name is Justis.

I am currently a 22 yr old Cyber Operations (Engineering focus) student at the University of Arizona. I have an underlying interest Reverse Engineering, Network Pentesting, Malware Development, Web App Pentesting, and more. Addmittedly, im still a SKID at heart and always will be a skid. Bear with me throughout these posts as they may seem elementary at times. 

# What is the purpose of this site?

This blog is meant as a means to keep track of progress as I gain further experience within my skill-set along with sharing back to the infosec community.

# Why the domain name "departmentofwarfare"

Funnily enough, I bought this domain as a joke originally. But after some consideration, I felt like this domain name would be a legendary if the name DOW does become ratified within the U.S.
